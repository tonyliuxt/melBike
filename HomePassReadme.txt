Write an Android or iOS application that consumes data from the following service:
https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport-Movement/Melbourne-bike-share/tdvh-n9dv/about


Your app should:
1.     Place items onto a full screen Google Map.
2.     Plot each of the stations as a circle on the map ensuring that the size of the circle is related to the number of bikes available.
3.     Have a search box which lets users find stations.
a.     Present an auto suggestion box as the user types.
b.     Upon tapping on the auto suggestion, you should scroll to the pin and show an option to get directions.
c.     If they tap get directions, you should open up navigation directions in Apple/Google Maps taking the user from where they are, to the location of the bike station.
4.	Any other functionality that you believe will help make the application easy to use and understand


You can download the dataset and use it locally. If you want to impress us, feel free to integrate directly with the above site.


We will be looking at:
1.     Code quality (naming, abstraction, testing)
2.     Presentation quality (your app looks and feels good)
3.	Tests (unit, BDD tests)

Think of this as your “audition tape”, which gives us an idea of the kind of developer you are and frames you in the best possible light.


Submitting your app:
Your solution should be tarred and gzipped up then sent back to us as <firstname>-<lastname>.tar.gz.
Your solution should hold a git repository and a README explaining how to run the code inside of it.
Do not make your submission publically visible via Github

Have fun, and good luck!
